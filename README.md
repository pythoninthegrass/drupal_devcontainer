# Drupal devcontainer

Generic demonstration of a Drupal devcontainer setup

## Status

This is the initial copy / adaptation of work I've done elsewhere. It is not yet tested or well documented.

## Usage

Clone this project to your computer.

Open in VS Code.

When prompted to open in container, accept. This will build the necessary containers.

## Includes

Three containers: a PHP-FPM container built on Oracle Linux 8, an Apache container built on Oracle Linux 8, and a MariaDB container.

Pa11y accessibility testing tool.

XDebug for PHP testing.
